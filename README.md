# CodeLens

CodeLens is an open-source student coding performance analytics platform designed for colleges.

It helps institutions track, analyze, and improve students’ coding progress using structured performance snapshots, growth analytics, and dynamic leaderboards.

Each college can deploy its own instance.

## 🎯 Why CodeLens?

Most colleges track coding performance manually or inconsistently.

Problems:
- No structured growth tracking
- No historical performance insights
- No analytics-driven mentoring
- No centralized leaderboard system
- No transparency in student improvement

CodeLens solves this by introducing a time-series snapshot engine that enables measurable, consistent progress tracking.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

CodeLens is built around a simple but powerful model:

Student  
→ Snapshots  
→ Analytics  
→ Leaderboards  

Snapshots are the source of truth.  
Analytics are computed from snapshots.  
Leaderboards are generated from analytics.

This separation ensures scalability, clarity, and long-term maintainability.
